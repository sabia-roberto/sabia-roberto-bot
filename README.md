# sabia-roberto-bot
Dictionary bot for /r/portuguese community's discord

It's based on wiktionary, guaranteeing that the source dictionary is free forever and that it's community-contributable.

I _might_ have future plans for including an additional dictionary source of a brand new community-contributable dictionary for example sentences, expressions, _g√≠rias_ and as a witkionary-alternative overall.

## Key Features
* can show meanings in both english and portuguese (english by default for convenience to non-native speakers)
* ability to display a word's etymology
* fuzzy search suggestions
